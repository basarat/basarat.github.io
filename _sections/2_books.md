## TypeScript Deep Dive

Due to my extensive work with the TypeScript community there were thoughts that I wanted to share on the subject. I collated them in [an open source book called TypeScript Deep Dive](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript). Its the [number one google result for TypeScript book](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=typescript+book).

## Others
I've also [reviewed](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/mastering-typescript) -- [other](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/typescript-essentials) TypeScript books and would be happy to review a chapter if you want me to.
