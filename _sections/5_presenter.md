Variously [random](https://twitter.com/PicnicSoftware/status/538111725732507649) -- [talks](http://www.meetup.com/MelbNodeJS/events/222926818/) -- [even remotely](http://www.meetup.com/Adelaide-dotNET/events/231160074/).

Also [YouTube](http://youtube.com/basaratali) : Haven't published much, but still have 700+ subscribers and 125K+ views, which isn't bad for just random developer videos.

Would be happy to do a talk [if you want me to](https://twitter.com/basarat). Otherwise I'm mostly busy creating or helping others with OSS projects.
